## Disease_classifier_based_on_symptoms:
- #### Disease classification is a ML approach to predict or diagnose the disease using the symptoms.
- #### I have used Random Forest Classifier in this project and the UI is created using Streamlit.

## Links:
- #### [Hugging face 🤗](https://huggingface.co/spaces/30Kanika/disease-classifier) 
- #### [Kaggle dataset 📘](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction)

## Steps to use Hugging face:
#### STEP 1 -After you open the hugging face link ,it will ask you to enter the symptoms you are facing.

#### STEP 2 -Enter the symptoms.

#### STEP 3 -Click "Detect" button, and it will show the disease name, description of that disease, and what are the precautions for that.
